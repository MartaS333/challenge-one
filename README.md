# Challenge-One Code Refactoring

**How I cleaned up the CSS file:**

* Moved the element selectors all to the top of the CSS file.
* Grouped class selectors that had the same CSS attributes together.
* Added comments that explained what part of the webpage was being styled and how.
* Added appropriate spacing so all brackets appeared to the left for easier troubleshooting.
* Created a :root directory for reoccuring CSS attributes and located it at the top of the file.
